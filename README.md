# Node.js & Express Fundamentals

This repository documents my learning journey through a Node.js & Express course, covering backend fundamentals, server-side concepts, and building structured web applications using MVC architecture.

## 📌 Course Overview
This course introduces Node.js from scratch and gradually moves into building real-world Express applications connected to MongoDB.

Topics include servers, routing, middleware, databases, and clean project structure.
